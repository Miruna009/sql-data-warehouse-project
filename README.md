This repository demonstrates a **modern data warehousing and analytics solution** using SQL Server. 
It highlights end-to-end data engineering skills, from building ETL pipelines to designing star-schema data models and generating SQL-based analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project follows a **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

- **Bronze Layer** – Raw data ingestion from CSV files into SQL Server.  
- **Silver Layer** – Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization.  
- **Gold Layer** – Business-ready data modeled in a **star schema** for reporting and analytics.
